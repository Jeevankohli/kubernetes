Toleration: tolerations are applied at the level of pods. when the taint and tolerations match eachother pod will run on the tainted machine.
----------
now taint remainig two nodes using the command
-> kubectl taint nodes {paste the copied node} slave1=jeevan:NoSchedule
                                                {key}={value}:{effect}
-> output  = node/copiednode has tainted
-> kubectl apply -f node_taint.yaml
now the pods will reamain on the pending status ... because we tainted all the machines
now if we want to run pod on that tainted machines we use tolerations.
