Node-taint: node taint will repel pods from a particular node/slave. Those pods will never run on the tainted nodes/slave they will run on other slaves
-> kubectl get nodes
-> copy any of the node
along with key & value we need to specify something called as effect 
-> kubectl taint nodes {paste the copied node} slave1=jeevan:NoSchedule
                                                {key}={value}:{effect}
-> output  = node/copiednode has tainted
